> Precision dart coordinates for serious bar sports.

A realtime solution to track `(x,z)` coordinates with `fastai` and `unets` using segmentations layers, rather than classical regression.

# Bootleg Method via `fastai` v2
> Why go out with your friends, when you can recreate it at home and have 35% of the fun by youself? 

Take your own pictures, find the `x,y` coordinates of the dart point using a bastardized unet segmentation layer.

# Secret Training method

The real dataset I built (300 pictures of me holding a dart) simply wasn't training. I new something must be wrong with my training pipelines - beacuse conceptually the CNN only needs to identify a couply of lines and the dart tip (!) so I was deeply suspicious and confused when the regression model wouldn't converge on anything near the correct coordinates.  

Using blender I simulated a simplified version of the problem. With this I could determin whether it was my training database that was wrong, or whether it was my ML/Dl approach that was wrong.
